 Simple Top-down shooter game. This was the second version made. The first one is still available in my Github.
 
 In this project, i had chance to use:
 - Unity's new Input System;
 - Object pooling (static and dynamic);
 - A* Pathfinding algorithm.
 
 Currently, the game is planned to work in the editor only.
